👋 Greetings! I'm @Okultix—an illustrator and 3D artist with a deep-rooted love for coding.
👀 While I may not be a prodigy in development, I enjoy delving into various languages and experimenting with them.
🌱 Currently, I'm immersing myself in UI/UX and navigating the realms of CSS and JS. I'm also dipping my toes into the world of C++.
💞️ I'm eager to collaborate on projects that merge the realms of art and code in innovative ways.
📫 Feel free to reach out to me anytime at okultix@yahoo.com. Let's create something remarkable together!
